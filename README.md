### How to Use
Download unbias.zip from this repository and extract the files. Then, open Google Chrome or a browser of your choice, and find the extensions page. On Chrome, you'll need to have "Developer Mode" enabled, but this may vary for other browsers. Finally, click the "Load Unpacked" button and select the folder that contains the Chrome Extension. You're ready to use Unbias!

### What is This?
Unbias is an app designed to identify and report potential biases in news and articles. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, Unbias can quickly scan text and produce a balanced summary of the text you are reading. Whether you're a high-school student trying to stay informed on current political events, or you're preparing to vote in upcoming elections, Unbias is an essential tool for you. It's important for people to read the news and know what's going on, but reading through bias develops unhealthy political opinions. Therefore, Unbias provides an easy way to both find bias and provide alternate perspectives on political issues. By using Unbias, you will read through a balanced lens, as well as develop a well-informed political opinion.

For now, I've left an API Key in there in case you want to test the app, but if it ends up being used up I'll remove it from the repository and include Quick Setup instructions.
